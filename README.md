# PCA-method

The Principal Component Analysis is a popular unsupervised learning technique for reducing the dimensionality of data. It increases interpretability yet, at the same time, it minimizes information loss. It helps to find the most significant features in a dataset and makes the data easy for plotting in 2D and 3D.

In this notebook we will be testing the PCA (Principal components) method.
1. First we will upload the MNIST dataset which is a large collection of handwritten digits. It is a very popular dataset in the field of image processing. It is often used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

2. We will compute the PCA method (steps are mentioned in the notebook)
